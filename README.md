# Threads

The aim of this project is to design a system that uses four types of threads: Reader, Upper, Replace and Writer. The Reader threads will read lines from an input file and store them in an array. The Upper threads will take the lines from the array and convert them to upper case and store them back in the array. The Replace threads will take the lines from the array and replace spaces with underscores and store them back in the array. The Writer threads will take the lines from the array and write them to an output file.
